# Reading View

Last modified: 16/02/2026

## Overview

Reading View controls how LearnKit card blocks look in Obsidian reading mode.

It does not change card data. It only changes how cards are displayed while reading notes.

## What's shown in reading view

In reading mode, LearnKit can show:

- Card type badge (Basic, Cloze, MCQ, IO, Ordered).
- Formatted card fields.
- Edit button for quick edits.
- Group tags.

## Appearance settings

Change these in **Settings → Reading**:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Enable card styling** | When off, cards use native Obsidian reading view with no LearnKit styling |
| **Macro styles** | Currently available: Disabled, Flashcards, and Clean markdown. More styles are planned for a future update |
| **Reading view fields** | Configure visible fields per macro style |
| **Reading view colours** | Customise card colours for styles that support colour settings |
| **Custom style CSS** | Reserved for the future Custom style (not active yet) |

## Macro styles

- **Disabled**: Uses native Obsidian reading rendering with LearnKit card styling turned off.
- **Flashcards**: Front/back flip cards (question on front, answer on back).
- **Clean markdown**: Minimal, tidied markdown-style card rendering.

Planned for a future release: **Classic**, **Guidebook**, and **Custom**.

For details, see [Reading View Styles](./Reading-View-Styles.md) and [Custom Reading Styles](./Custom-Reading-Styles.md).

## Interaction

- **Edit button** opens the card editor for that card.
- Cloze cards can show hints or blanks, based on your settings.
- Embedded images render inline.
- Math uses Obsidian LaTeX rendering.

## Tips

- Use Reading View to spot formatting problems before studying.
- If a card looks wrong, use Edit directly from the card block.
- If a card block does not render as expected, check card syntax and run a sync.
